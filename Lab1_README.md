This is my first simple web application test using Burp community tool
I just followed the instruction which I will briefly explain it in few steps:
    1-I used my portswigger account to logg into the blog page and I tried to enter random userName and password 
    that was enough to recored the url request and response action on Burp platform
    2-Under the payloads tab I choose the type to be simple list, I pasted some usernames in the payloads options [simple list]
    3-under url that I want to attack I sent it to intuder and from there I applied the follwing:
                              a- In the position tab I cleared the highlighted formats by clicking clear
                              b- I only highlighted the username then I clicked add button
                              c The type of attack is Sniper
                              d-start attack
Same pattern for password.
